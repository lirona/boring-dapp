                            and incentivizing them
                            to act individually in their hyperlocal environment
                            in small steps as a part of a globally distributed local communities for environmental impact (through financial nudges and on-chain proof).
                            We do that in a easy, fun, convenient, secure, transparent and verifiable way.
